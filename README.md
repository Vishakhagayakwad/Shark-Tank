# Shark Tank Dataset Analysis

## Overview

I'm excited to share my latest project where I analyzed the Shark Tank dataset to uncover investment trends and insights. The project involved data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain a deeper understanding of the investment landscape on Shark Tank.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Brands:** Various companies featured on Shark Tank
- **Investment Amounts:** Investments made by sharks (in Lakhs INR)
- **Debt:** Debt amounts offered (in Lakhs INR)
- **Number of Sharks:** Number of sharks investing in each brand

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Manipulation

- **Libraries Used:** Leveraged Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Data Cleaning:** Read the dataset and checked for null and duplicate values to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Key Insights:**
  - **Maximum Equity Offered:** 75% of the company
  - **Highest Valuation:** ₹27 Crore 98 Lakh offered by sharks
  - **Maximum Investment:** ₹80 Lakh made by sharks in season 1
  - **Highest Debt Offered:** ₹99 Lakh

- **Sharks' Investment Analysis:**
  - **Number of Sharks per Brand:** Maximum of 5 sharks invested in each brand
  - **Shark Interests:** Aman Gupta (co-Founder of Boat) invested in the most companies (26 brands), while Ghazal Alagh (co-Founder of MamaEarth) invested in the fewest (7 brands).

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Top Investments:** Plotted a bar chart showing the top 5 investments.
- **Top Valued Companies:** Visualized the top 10 companies by valuation.
- **Total Investments by Shark:** Calculated and visualized total investments made by each shark. Found that Namita Thapar made the highest total investment (₹476.83 Lakhs), followed by Vineeta Singh (₹384.83 Lakhs).

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results and Insights

The analysis provided valuable insights into investment patterns on Shark Tank, including:
- Distribution of investments and valuations
- Individual shark contributions and interests
- Investment trends over different seasons

The visualizations offer a clear understanding of which sharks are investing the most and which brands are attracting the highest valuations.
