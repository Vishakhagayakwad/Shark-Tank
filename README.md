ðŸš€ Thrilled to share that I've completed another amazing project on Shark Tank dataset in which I followed these following steps! â¤µ 

âš« Leveraged Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data manipulation.

âš« Conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

âš« Delivered insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

This dataset consists of varieties of brands, Investment Amounts(In Lakhs INR), Debt(In Lakhs INR), and the number of sharks who are investing in particular brand. First I read the data and checked for null and duplicate values to remove it. It is observed that

- Maximum Equity Offered is 75 % of the Company

- 27 Crore 98 Lakh is the Highest Valuation which was offered by sharks

- 80 Lakh is the maximum Investment made by Sharks in a brand for season 1

- 99 Lakh is highest debt offered.

ðŸ”·Then I checked how many sharked invested in each brand. I found that the maximum number of sharks invested in each brand is 5.

ðŸ”·After this I checked for interests of sharks and observed that Aman Gupta (co-Founder of Boat) had invested in maximum Companies (i.e. 26 Brands) and Ghazal Alagh (co-Founder of MamaEarth) had invested in minimum Companies (i.e. 7 Brands). 

ðŸ”·Then I plotted bar plot for top 5 investments and top 10 valued companies.

ðŸ”· I also checked total investments made by each shark and found that Total Investments made by Namita Thapar is 476.83333333333(In Lakhs INR) and Total Investments made by Vineeta Singh is 384.83333333333337(In Lakhs INR)
